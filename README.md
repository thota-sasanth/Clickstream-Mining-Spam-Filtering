# Clickstream-Mining-Spam-Filtering
In this project, we created two models - 1. Decision Tree model based on ID3 algorithm 2. Naive Bayes classifier. The decision tree model was trained on "KDD Cup 2000" clickstream data which was used to classify if a visitor views a page-site or leaves. The decision tree was generated from scratch using the ID3 algorithm. The naive bayes classifier was trained on "2005 TREC Public Spam Corpus" data. The classifier was used to classify if an email is spam or ham.
